This all changed, however when Nappa and Vegeta arrived on their way to Earth. They purposefully let themselves be caught, and they had to participate in the battles. After the two Saiyans defeated all of the combatents, they killed the dictator. The evil ruler had taken away one of the inhabitant's wife, and just as they were reunited, Vegeta blows up the entire planet and everything on it. Shows you what a nice guy Vegeta is!<br><br>Earth<br>This is the planet where most of DB/Z/GT took place. It is where Goku landed as a baby, and is the place where most everything happens. It also happens to be the planet you're standing on right now ;).<br><br>Kanassa<br>Bardock gets his gift (curse?) to see the future from this planet.<br> <br>Old Namek<br>All the Nameks, a race of green and pink humanoids, are from this planet, including Piccolo. It was destroyed by Freeza in his battle with Son Goku. <br> <br>Old Vegita (Planet Plant)<br>This is the planet where the Saiyans are from. It was originally ruled by two groups, the Tsufuru-jin (Truffles) and the Saiyans. While the Saiyans you already know about, you may be unfamiliar with the Truffles. While a very scientific and advanced race, they were considerabley weaker than the Saiyans. The had amazing weapons, but in the end they were defeated by the Saiyan's mighty Oozaru tranformation at the full moon. This planet is, oddly enough, ALSO destroyed by Freeza. He thought the Saiyans might one day overthrow him, so he blew them all up. Only a handful (Kakarotto-Goku, Raditz, Nappa, Vegeta, Taurus, Paragus, and Broli) who were off-planet at the time survived. Freeza WAS eventually overthrown by the Saiyans, Son Goku, one of the last two pure-blooded Saiyans, defeated him on Old Namek. Freeza was killed by a half-Saiyan, Trunks.<br><br>New Namek <br>The new Planet Namek made to replace the former, destroyed one. It was created by Porunga, and is the current home of the Nameks.<br><br>Freeza Planet #79<br>One of Freeza's military bases, it is the one where the Ginyu Force, Vegeta, and Kiwi are stationed. It is the only one of Freeza's bases we see. What happens to the base after Freeza's death is unknown.<br><br></font><u><font face="Arial" size="-2">Other Bodies:</font></u><font face="Arial" size="-2"><br>Big Ghetti Star<br>Of unknown origin, the Big Ghetti Star was a living machine that &quot;ate&quot; planets and other objects. It found the remains of Koola and used them to power the enormous parasite. It, along with Koola, is destroyed by Goku and Vegeta.</font></td>
